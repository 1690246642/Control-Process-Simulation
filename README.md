# Control-Process-Simulation
Simulation of an nC4/nC5 distillation column using MATLAB, focusing on stabilizing a non-ideal system with tuned controllers. Includes full code (some parts need improvement) and a PDF detailing goals, challenges, and comparisons to William Luyben's Simulink model. Updates planned for future versions
